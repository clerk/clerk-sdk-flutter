# clerk_test

`clerk_test` provides test infrastructure that can be shared across `clerk_auth` and `clerk_flutter`

## Features

- A mock for the `HttpService` class which can be injected into test objects so that no actual http call is made
- a recording mode that, when provided with appropriate credentials, enables the test `HttpService` to record back end responses in real time

## Getting started

See the `pubspec.yaml` file in  `clerk_auth` and `clerk_flutter`

## Usage

See the `pubspec.yaml` file in  `clerk_auth` and `clerk_flutter`
